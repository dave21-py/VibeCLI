### VibeCLI

An AI-powered, real-time UNIX-style shell with a chill vibe. Powered by Google Gemini.

This project is a Node.js command-line interface that uses the Gemini API to interpret user commands and stream back a simulated shell output. It's less of a tool and more of a creative coding assistant—it can simulate file operations, git commands, network tools, and even code execution, all while maintaining a low-key, knowledgeable personality.

### Tips for Getting Started

1.  **Ask anything:** Try standard commands like `ls -a`, `cat <filename>`, or `git status`.
2.  **Be specific:** For the best results, treat it like a real shell.
3.  **Simulate code:** Try `node -e "console.log('sup world')"`
4.  **Exit:** Just type `exit` to close the shell.
